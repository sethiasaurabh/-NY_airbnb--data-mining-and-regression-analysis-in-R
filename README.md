# -NY_airbnb--data-mining-and-regression-analysis-in-R

This is a data set of New_york_aribnb 2019, I took this dataset from Kaggle. Firtsly, I did data cleaning then run EDA, then I make linear regression model to predict the prices of the room according to the room types and their locations. Then I tried to optimise my initial model by using backward selection method, after removing outliers from the data and change the data types of some variables to include that variables my model.
